# vmA2s

> Some architecture and code which I'm building during my winter break of 2023 as I progress in my MS in Information Security at Caregie Mellon University. I've decided to include intentionally unorganized snippets of modified code from the full time project I built at my previous work role as a Security Software Engineer in DevSecOps. For obvious reasons, I cannot open source the entire project.

# Architecture

1. Jenkins as CI/CD
2. Maven to build code
3. JUnit test cases
4. SonarQube for code quality
5. Docker image scanning using Trivy => Push to Docker
6. Upload Scan Reports to Cloud
7. Secret Management using HashiCorp Vault
8. Alerting using Teams/Slack

Maybe I will convert this into a diagram for better representation.
